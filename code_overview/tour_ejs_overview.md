# tour.ejs Overview

This file is a simple EJS template for the "Farm Tours" page. It currently acts as a placeholder page with static content.

## Code Walkthrough

### 1. Include Header Partial
```ejs
<%- include('partials/header') %>
```
- **`<%- include(...) %>`**: This EJS tag includes the content of `header.ejs` at the top of the page. The `<%-` syntax is used to output raw, unescaped HTML, which is necessary for including other templates.

### 2. Main Page Content
```html
<main class="static-page">
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Farm Tours</h1>
    <p>
      Information about our farm tours will be available here soon. Stay tuned!
    </p>
  </div>
</main>
```
- This is standard HTML that structures the main content area of the page.
- It contains a title (`<h1>`) and a paragraph (`<p>`) with placeholder text.
- There is no dynamic data or complex EJS logic in this file, as it serves a static purpose for now.

### 3. Include Footer Partial
```ejs
<%- include('partials/footer') %>
```
- Embeds the shared footer from `footer.ejs` at the bottom of the page, ensuring a consistent layout across the site.

**How it fits:**
- **View in MVC**: This is the "View" for the `/tour` route.
- **Static Content**: It is rendered by the `getTourPage` controller, which simply tells Express to display this static template.
- **Placeholder**: This page serves as a placeholder and can be easily updated later with dynamic content (like a list of tour dates from a database) without changing the surrounding application structure.
