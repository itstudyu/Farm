# index.ejs Overview

This file is the EJS template for the website's home page. It serves as a central hub, showcasing various sections of the site like featured products, blog posts, and calls to action.

## Code Walkthrough

### 1. Include Header Partial
```ejs
<%- include('partials/header') %>
```
- Embeds the shared header into the page.

### 2. Main Home Page Structure
The home page is built from several distinct sections:
```html
<main class="home-page">
  <!-- Hero Section -->
  <section class="hero-section" ...> ... </section>

  <!-- Featured Products Section -->
  <section class="featured-products" ...> ... </section>

  <!-- About Us Section -->
  <section class="home-about" ...> ... </section>

  <!-- Featured Blog Posts Section -->
  <section class="featured-blog" ...> ... </section>

  <!-- Call to Action (CTA) Section -->
  <section class="cta-section" ...> ... </section>
</main>
```
- This HTML provides the overall structure for the home page, with each `<section>` representing a different content block.

### 3. Displaying Featured Products and Blog Posts
The logic for displaying featured items is similar to the `shop.ejs` and `blog.ejs` templates, but likely with a smaller, curated set of data.
- **Featured Products**:
  ```ejs
  <div class="product-grid">
    <% if (products && products.length > 0) { %>
      <% products.forEach(function(product) { %>
        <!-- Product Card HTML -->
      <% }); %>
    <% } %>
  </div>
  ```
- **Featured Blog Posts**:
  ```ejs
  <div class="blog-posts-grid">
    <% if (posts && posts.length > 0) { %>
      <% posts.forEach(function(post) { %>
        <!-- Blog Post Card HTML -->
      <% }); %>
    <% } %>
  </div>
  ```
- **`if (products && ...)` and `if (posts && ...)`**: These scriptlet tags check if the `products` and `posts` arrays were passed from the controller. This is important because the home page might need data from multiple database tables.
- **`forEach(...)`**: Loops are used to render a card for each featured product and blog post.
- The `getHomePage` controller is responsible for fetching this data (e.g., the latest 3 products and 2 blog posts) and passing it to this template.

### 4. Include Footer Partial
```ejs
<%- include('partials/footer') %>
```
- Embeds the shared footer at the end of the page.

**How it fits:**
- **View in MVC**: This is the "View" for the `/` (home) route.
- **Dashboard/Hub**: It acts as the main landing page, providing visitors with a snapshot of what the site has to offer and directing them to other key pages.
- **Data Aggregator**: The `getHomePage` controller that renders this view has to aggregate data from different sources (products, posts, etc.) and pass it all to this single template. This makes the home page one of the more complex views in terms of data requirements.
