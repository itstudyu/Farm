# Code Overview: JavaScript/TypeScript Concepts for Java Developers

This document explains key coding concepts and patterns used in your Node.js/Express project, with code examples and explanations for someone familiar with Java but new to JavaScript/TypeScript.

---

## 1. `const localsMiddleware` â€” What does it mean?

```typescript
const localsMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  // ...function body...
};
```

- **`const`**: Declares a constant variable (cannot be reassigned).
- **`localsMiddleware`**: The name of the variable (here, a function).
- **`(req, res, next) => { ... }`**: This is an **arrow function** (like a lambda in Java 8+). It takes three arguments and returns nothing (void).
- In Express, middleware functions always have the signature `(req, res, next)`.
- This function is exported and used to add data to the response (`res.locals`) for use in templates.

**Java analogy:**

```java
// Java 8+ lambda for a functional interface
MyMiddleware localsMiddleware = (req, res, next) -> {
    // ...
};
```

---

## 2. How do arrow functions (lambdas) work?

**Arrow functions** are a concise way to write functions in JavaScript/TypeScript. They are similar to Java lambdas.

**Example:**

```typescript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

- This is equivalent to `int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }` in Java.

**Multi-line arrow function:**

```typescript
const greet = (name) => {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
};
```

**In your code:**

```typescript
const router = Router();
router.get("/about", (req, res) => {
  res.render("about", { title: "About Us" });
});
```

## 3. How does this lambda work on images in EJS?

In EJS templates, you might see code like this:

```ejs
<% products.forEach(product => { %>
  <img src="<%= product.image %>" alt="<%= product.name %>">
<% }) %>
```

- `products.forEach(product => { ... })` is an arrow function (lambda) that runs for each product in the array.
- For each product, it outputs an `<img>` tag with the product's image and name.

**Java analogy:**

```java
products.forEach(product -> {
    System.out.println("<img src='" + product.image + "' alt='" + product.name + "'>");
});
```

---

## 4. What is `module.exports` / `export`?

- In Node.js, files are modules. You export functions/objects to use them in other files.
- In TypeScript/ES6:

```typescript
export const myFunction = () => { ... };
```

- In CommonJS (older Node.js):

```javascript
module.exports = myFunction;
```

---

## 5. What is `require` vs `import`?

- `require` is the old way (CommonJS):

```javascript
const express = require("express");
```

- `import` is the modern way (ES6/TypeScript):

```typescript
import express from "express";
```

---

## 6. What is `async`/`await`?

- Used for asynchronous (non-blocking) code, especially with database calls.
- `async` marks a function as asynchronous.
- `await` pauses the function until a Promise resolves.

**Example:**

```typescript
const getUser = async (id) => {
  const user = await db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", [id]);
  return user;
};
```

**Java analogy:**

```java
// Java's CompletableFuture
CompletableFuture<User> getUser(int id) {
    return db.queryAsync("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", id);
}
```

---

## 7. What is `res.render`?

- Renders an EJS template and sends HTML to the browser.
- Example:

```typescript
res.render("about", { title: "About Us" });
```

- This finds `views/about.ejs`, fills in `<%= title %>` with "About Us", and sends the result.

---

## 8. What is `req.session`?

- Stores data for a user's session (like login state, flash messages).
- Example:

```typescript
req.session.user = { id: user.id, name: user.name };
```

- This data is available on every request from that user until they log out.

---

## 9. What is `res.locals`?

- Data attached to `res.locals` is available in all EJS templates for that request.
- Example:

```typescript
res.locals.user = req.session.user;
```

- In EJS: `<%= user.name %>`

---

## 10. What is `next()` in middleware?

- In Express, middleware functions must call `next()` to pass control to the next handler.
- If you forget `next()`, the request will hang.

**Example:**

```typescript
const myMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  // do something
  next(); // pass to next middleware/route
};
```
