          <h3>The Beginning</h3>
          <p>
            Our story starts with a small patch of land and a big dream. We
            began by growing simple, hardy perennials, selling bouquets from a
            roadside stand. It was a humble start, fueled by a passion for
            seeing things grow.

          <h3>Finding Our Niche</h3>
          <p>
            We discovered a love for unique and heirloom flower varieties. This
            marked a turning point, as we shifted our focus to cultivating
            specialty cut flowers that were hard to find elsewhere, attracting a
            dedicated local following.

          <h3>Expansion & Workshops</h3>
          <p>
            With growing demand, we acquired more land and built our first
            greenhouse. We also began hosting floral design workshops, sharing
            our knowledge and passion with a budding community of flower lovers.

            and anyone who appreciates the beauty of nature. We continue to
